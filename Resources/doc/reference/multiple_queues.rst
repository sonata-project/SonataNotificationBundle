Multiple queues
===============

Some notification backends support running multiple queues (currently rabbitmq only).

This makes it possible to send different messages to different queues - for example to avoid messages which take longer
to consume to block messages which take only a short amount of time.

To enable multiple queues, simply define a `queues` node in your configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    sonata_notification: 
        backend: sonata.notification.backend.rabbitmq
        queues: 
            - { queue: transcoder, routing_key: start.transcode.video }
            - { queue: catchall, default: true }
        backends: 
            rabbitmq: 
                exchange:     router
                connection:
                    host:     %rabbitmq_host%
                    user:     %rabbitmq_user%
                    pass:     %rabbitmq_pass%
                    port:     %rabbitmq_port%
                    vhost:    %rabbitmq_vhost%
                
                
This will define 2 different queues: `transcoder` and `catchall` and where the `transcoder` queue is bound to a routing key:

    - `start.transcode.video`
    
In the above example you will need to create 2 consumers, where each consumer will handle messages sent by a specific queue:

    - `php app/console sonata:notification:start --env=prod --iteration=250 --type=start.transcode.video`
    - `php app/console sonata:notification:start --env=prod --iteration=250`
    
    
When publishing a message with the type `start.transcode.video`, those messages will be handled by the first consumer.
Any other messagetype will be handled by the `catchall` consumer, as it has been set to be the default one.
